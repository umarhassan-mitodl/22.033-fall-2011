The readings on this page constitute a general overview and introduction to the course topics.

Each sub-task group begins their investigation with a literature search. By the end of the semester, students will have read and discussed a large number of other sources. The {{% resource_link 72ee7639-0e17-ec22-2b1a-a6d5bb9c5925 "final project report" "#Final" %}} lists these additional readings in the References section.

## Core

{{% resource_link 8a0fbf6f-8037-2376-8811-c2a087625134 "GIF R&D Outlook for Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems (PDF)" %}} (Courtesy of the Generation IV International Forum. Used with permission.)   
A report prepared for the [Generation IV International Forum Technology Roadmap](https://www.gen-4.org/gif/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-03/gif-tru2014.pdf) on new reactor concepts and their R&D status.

_Nuclear Energy Research and Development Roadmap_. U.S. Department of Energy. April 2010. ({{% resource_link 6a2afa14-552d-7d18-ad15-a726bbd3334f "PDF - 3.7MB" %}})   
This is a good summary of some of the issues to keep in mind when deciding on your choice of reactor technology.

## Process Heat

Demirbas, M. Faith. "[Thermal Energy Storage and Phase Change Materials: An Overview](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/009083190881481)." _Energy Sources_ 1, no. 1 (2006): 85–95.   
A good summary and references about well-established heat storage methods with a large number of compound properties.

## Hydrogen

Yildiz, B., and M. S. Kazimi. "[Efficiency of Hydrogen Production Systems Using Alternative Nuclear Energy Technologies](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2005.02.009)." _International Journal of Hydrogen Energy_ 31, no. 1 (2006): 77–92.   
A summary of some major technologies for hydrogen production, and ways that nuclear power is suited to drive them.

## Biofuels

Lynd, L. R., et al. "[The Role of Biomass in America's Energy Future: Framing the Analysis](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bbb.134)." _Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining_ 3, no. 2 (2009): 113–23.   
An excellent summary of how the leaders in biofuel plant design forsee it playing a role in our future. TONS of good references in here; also check the journal for more papers in this series.
