The readings on this page constitute a general overview and introduction to the course topics.

Each sub-task group begins their investigation with a literature search. By the end of the semester, students will have read and discussed a large number of other sources. The {{% resource_link 72ee7639-0e17-ec22-2b1a-a6d5bb9c5925 "final project report" "#Final" %}} lists these additional readings in the References section.

## Core

A good summary and references about well-established heat storage methods with a large number of compound properties.

## Hydrogen

Yildiz, B., and M. S. Kazimi. "{{% resource_link "d2467db4-7fd7-45b6-b2fe-9cd533b7ee24" "Efficiency of Hydrogen Production Systems Using Alternative Nuclear Energy Technologies" %}}." _International Journal of Hydrogen Energy_ 31, no. 1 (2006): 77–92.   
A summary of some major technologies for hydrogen production, and ways that nuclear power is suited to drive them.

## Biofuels

Lynd, L. R., et al. "{{% resource_link "a5e41eda-782b-44f8-9973-8459c12e8062" "The Role of Biomass in America's Energy Future: Framing the Analysis" %}}." _Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining_ 3, no. 2 (2009): 113–23.   
An excellent summary of how the leaders in biofuel plant design forsee it playing a role in our future. TONS of good references in here; also check the journal for more papers in this series.
